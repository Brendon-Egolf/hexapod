# How I Designed This

This design is based off of the [beaglebone black slim case](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:471661) by Scuttlebot.  The design was reworked in [Autodesk Fusion 360](http://www.autodesk.com/education/free-software/fusion-360) using design features and dimensions from the original design.

The design files are available [here](http://a360.co/1K6vzCN) for anyone with Fusion 360.
